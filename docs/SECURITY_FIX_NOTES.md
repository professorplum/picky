# Security Fix Notes

## RESOLVED: Hardcoded Cosmos DB Emulator Key

### Issue (Resolved)
Hardcoded Cosmos DB emulator key in configuration posed potential security risk.

### Resolution
The application now uses Azure Key Vault for secure credential management:

**Current Implementation:**
```python
# Credentials are retrieved from Azure Key Vault
secrets_service = get_secrets_service()
connection_string = secrets_service.get_cosmos_connection_string(environment)
```

### Security Improvements
1. ✅ **No hardcoded credentials** - All secrets stored in Azure Key Vault
2. ✅ **Environment-specific secrets** - Each environment has its own connection string
3. ✅ **Azure authentication** - Uses `DefaultAzureCredential` for secure access
4. ✅ **Automatic rotation** - Key Vault supports secret rotation without code changes

### Current Architecture
- **Local Development**: Uses `az login` authentication to access Key Vault
- **Azure Deployment**: Will use Managed Identity for Key Vault access
- **Secret Management**: All Cosmos DB connection strings stored securely in Key Vault
- **Environment Isolation**: Each environment uses separate secrets and containers

### Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: No credentials in code or environment variables
- **Centralized Management**: All secrets managed in one secure location
- **Audit Trail**: Key Vault provides access logging and monitoring
- **Compliance**: Meets enterprise security requirements

### Note
This implementation follows Azure security best practices and eliminates the need for hardcoded credentials while maintaining developer convenience through Azure CLI authentication.
