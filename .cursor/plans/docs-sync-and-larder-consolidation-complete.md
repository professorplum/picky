# Docs Sync and Larder Consolidation - Complete

## Overview

Successfully updated all documentation to match the current codebase state and consolidated duplicate larder plan files. This was a docs-only branch with no code changes.

## Completed Work

### ✅ Larder Plan Consolidation

- **Removed**: `.cursor/plan/larder-meals-implementation-plan.md` (duplicate)
- **Removed**: Empty `.cursor/plan/` directory
- **Kept**: `.cursor/plans/larder-meals-implementation-plan.md` (canonical version)

### ✅ README.md Updates

- **Architecture**: Updated to reflect current `DataLayer` + `DatabaseService` + Key Vault pattern
- **Features**: Replaced legacy meal planning with current three item types (larder, shopping, meals)
- **API Endpoints**: Updated table to match actual implemented endpoints
- **Run Commands**: Clarified `python -m backend.run` (port 5001), `./run-dev.sh` (port 8001), `python -m backend.app` (port 8000)
- **Key Vault**: Added Azure Key Vault configuration requirements and `az login` setup
- **Project Structure**: Aligned with actual files present, removed non-existent references
- **Environment**: Documented `ENV_NAME` vs `ENV` discrepancy for future fix

### ✅ Architecture Doc Updates (`docs/architecture.md`)

- **Current State**: Added three item types, Key Vault integration, local development focus
- **Environments**: Restructured to show Development (current) vs Staging/Production (planned)
- **CI/CD**: Documented GitHub Copilot PR review as current automation
- **Diagram**: Updated Mermaid diagram to show current local development flow vs planned Azure deployment
- **Monitoring**: Split into current (basic logging) vs planned (Application Insights)

### ✅ Development Workflow Doc Updates (`docs/development_workflow.md`)

- **Current vs Planned**: Added clear distinction between current local development and planned CI/CD
- **CI/CD**: Documented GitHub Copilot PR review as current automation, GitHub Actions as planned
- **Deployment**: Marked Azure App Service deployment as planned
- **Local Setup**: Added comprehensive local development setup instructions with Key Vault requirements

### ✅ Cosmos Schema Doc Updates (`docs/COSMOS_SCHEMA.md`)

- **Container Names**: Updated to reflect environment-derived naming (`dev-container`, `stage-container`, `prod-container`)
- **Environment Config**: Replaced direct environment variables with Key Vault configuration examples
- **Security**: Emphasized Key Vault for credential management across all environments

### ✅ Security Notes Updates (`docs/SECURITY_FIX_NOTES.md`)

- **Status**: Marked hardcoded credentials issue as resolved
- **Current Implementation**: Documented Azure Key Vault integration
- **Security Improvements**: Listed benefits of Key Vault approach
- **Architecture**: Explained local vs Azure authentication patterns

### ✅ CosmosDataLayer Reference Cleanup

- **Documentation**: All docs now reference current `DataLayer` + `DatabaseService` architecture
- **Legacy References**: Removed all `CosmosDataLayer` references from documentation
- **Note**: Test files and scripts still contain legacy references (outside scope of docs-only branch)

## Key Changes Summary

### Before

- Documentation referenced non-existent `CosmosDataLayer` and `cosmos_data_layer.py`
- API endpoints didn't match actual implementation
- Run commands referenced non-existent `activate.sh`
- Environment configuration showed direct Cosmos DB credentials
- Architecture described planned features as current

### After

- All docs reference current `DataLayer` + `DatabaseService` + Key Vault architecture
- API endpoints match actual implementation (`/api/larder-items`, `/api/shopping-items`, `/api/meal-items`)
- Run commands reflect actual available options
- Environment configuration shows Key Vault integration
- Clear distinction between current state and planned features

## Follow-up Items (Next Branch)

These items were identified but not implemented in this docs-only branch:

1. **Update `scripts/reset_cosmos.py`**: Remove `CosmosDataLayer` import, use new architecture
2. **Align Environment Variables**: Fix `ENV_NAME` vs `ENV` discrepancy between code and templates
3. **Add GitHub Actions CI**: Implement linting and testing workflows
4. **Consider Local Emulator Support**: Optional path for local Cosmos DB emulator

## Impact

- **Developer Experience**: Documentation now accurately reflects how to run and configure the application
- **Security**: All credential management properly documented with Key Vault approach
- **Maintenance**: Eliminated confusion between current and planned features
- **Onboarding**: New developers can follow accurate setup instructions

## Files Modified

- `README.md` - Complete rewrite to match current state
- `docs/architecture.md` - Updated with current vs planned distinctions
- `docs/development_workflow.md` - Added current vs planned sections
- `docs/COSMOS_SCHEMA.md` - Updated container naming and Key Vault config
- `docs/SECURITY_FIX_NOTES.md` - Marked security issue as resolved
- `.cursor/plan/` - Removed duplicate larder plan directory

All documentation now accurately reflects the current codebase state and provides clear guidance for both current local development and planned Azure deployment.
